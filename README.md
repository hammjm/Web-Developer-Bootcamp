<h1>Web-Developer-Bootcamp</h1>
<h3>All the fun of the web developer bootcamp, showcased as I work through it.</h3>
<br />
<p>I have previous experience as a web developer, but strictly with front-end development limitted to HTML5, CSS3, JS, as well as some PHP and SQL.
<br /> This course will help me improve on these skills, but also add a plethora of skills to my toolbox.</p>
<p> I look forward to the course, and will update this readme as my repository grows :) </p>
